# What is this all about ?
As a developer, I have heard a lot about shopify stores and shopify store owners needing help developing their store. I've always heard that Shopify uses something called "Liquid" to create their stores, and that developers need to learn liquid in order to do anything. Well I was curious and wanted to try learning more about Shopify development, as it seems like it is increasing in popularity. What I was surprised to learn is that you really just need to know some HTML and CSS to get started. What I was also surprised to learn is that I could not find a straight forward, simple guide to get started with Shopify for developers.

##  What this guide will go over
1. How to create a Shopify "development" store to get started.
2. How to add a theme to your store
3. How to edit your store's theme and add your own features to your store.


## Create your development store
If you're like me, you went and created a Shopify account became very confused when all you could do is create a store. I had no option to create a development store. Well that is because we need a partner account.
* You can create a partner account by going to the [Shopify partners webpage](https://www.shopify.com/partners) at shopify.com/partners. On this page click join now, and select the main way you plan on using this account. Continue through the questions until you get to your Shopify Partners dashboard.
Next we will create our development store. Follow these steps to do this:
* Click on "Stores" on the selection bar on the left side of the screen.
* Click "Add Store" on the top right of your screen ![[Pasted image 20240116023211.png]]
* Click "Create Development Store"
* There are 2 types of development stores:
	1. Create a store for a client
	2. Create a store to test and build

	In our case we want to select "Create a store to test and build". This allows us to freely write our code and test it on our store. If you are creating a store for a client and plan to transfer ownership to the client however, select the first one.
* You can now fill in the store name and keep the build version as current release. However, for the last selection, I like to start with test data. It makes the store a bit more filled in when you create it. This is not mandatory and you can experiment with this as you please.
